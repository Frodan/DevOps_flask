#Python

## Why I chose Flask
Application is very small python web server. I don't need heavy framework for such task. I don't even use a database. So Flask for this application is a my choice.


### Python Best Practices
- Module code
- Create proper comments and documentation
- Use proper names for variables
- Use four spaces instead of tabs
- Use virtual environment
- Follow PEP8
- Use PyPI instead of writing bicycles
- Use right data structures
- Have no more, than 80-100 chars per line
- Use Python3 instead of python2
- Create a requirements.txt
- Use Environment variables

### Implemented Unit Tests
First test check aviability of environment variables, that my app needs for execution.
Second test checks than site is working and index page returns status 200.

### Unit Test BEst Practices
- Tests should be fast
- Tests should be simple
- Tests should be readable
- Tests should not duplicate implementation logic
- Tests should be deterministic
- Make unit tests a part of build process
- Make a Sound Naming Convention
- Don't make unit tests too coupled to internals of code base
